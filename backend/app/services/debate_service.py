        You are simulating a philosophical debate between two thinkers on the topic of Dualism vs. Monism.
        
        The question being debated is: "{question}"
        
        You are responding as {current_thinker['name']}, who is a {current_thinker['position']}.
        {current_thinker['name']} {current_thinker['description']}
        
        Write a response that:
        1. Is faithful to {current_thinker['name']}'s philosophical position
        2. Uses terminology and arguments that this philosopher would use
        3. Directly addresses the question and previous points in the debate
        4. Is about 3-5 sentences long
        5. Is written in the style of the philosopher

        Pretend you are each thinker in the debate. This means you won't introduce your response or introduce yourself as an AI. You are legitimately the philosopher responding to the question.
